We introduce an AI-powered safety system that detects smoke/fire, violence, and faces in real time using three models running on a laptop. It sends instant alerts, logs events, and provides a live dashboard for monitoring. The setup uses cameras, ESP32 sensors, and a modular design, making it scalable for smart factory and industrial environments.
